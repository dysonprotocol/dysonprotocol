# 1-10 Fix orphaned index entries on task deletion

## Description
When a task is deleted via `MsgDeleteTask`, only the primary `Tasks` map entry is removed. The three secondary index keys (`i_addr`, `i_status_ts`, `i_status_gas`) remain, causing `BeginBlocker` to encounter orphaned keys and log "failed to load task" errors. This task will modify `Keeper.RemoveTask` so that it removes the index keys before deleting the primary record, ensuring data consistency.

## Requirements
1. `Keeper.RemoveTask` must:
   - Load the task (return error if not found).
   - Call `k.removeIndexes(ctx, task)` to delete secondary index keys.
   - Remove the primary record via `k.Tasks.Remove`.
2. Ensure existing call sites (`MsgDeleteTask`) continue to work without change.
3. Add inline comments explaining the cleanup.
4. No regression in existing tests.

## Implementation Plan
1. Update `x/crontask/keeper/keeper.go`:
   - In `RemoveTask`, fetch the task (`k.Tasks.Get`) before deletion.
   - If found, call `removeIndexes`.
   - Then delete primary entry.
2. Run `make test` to validate.
3. No other modules changed.

## Verification
- Create and then delete a task in integration tests; run one block and ensure the log does NOT show "failed to load task" for that task ID.

## Files Modified
- `x/crontask/keeper/keeper.go` (RemoveTask implementation)
- Tests if needed
