# 1-11 Clean up old crontasks

## Description
Introduce automatic deletion of tasks that have been in a terminal state (DONE, FAILED, EXPIRED) for longer than a configurable retention period.  This prevents the store from growing indefinitely.

Key elements:
1. **New module parameter** `clean_up_time` (int64 seconds) added to `Params` both in `crontask.proto` and Go types.  Default: 86400 (24 hours).
2. **Keeper logic**: implement `Keeper.removeOldTasks(ctx sdk.Context, cutoff int64)` that scans terminal-status tasks ordered by timestamp and removes those with `execution_timestamp` (or `expiry_timestamp`) older than `cutoff` seconds.
3. Invoke `removeOldTasks` from `BeginBlocker` once per block after normal processing/gas-limit checks.
4. Deletion must call `RemoveTask`, so secondary indexes are cleaned.

## Status History

## Requirements
1. Update proto definition (`proto/dysonprotocol/crontask/v1/crontask.proto`) and regenerate Go.
2. Add new field to `crontasktypes.Params`, with validation ensuring non-negative.
3. Expose param via CLI / genesis defaults.
4. **Add native governance-controlled `MsgUpdateParams` RPC (like `x/bank`) and wire an `authority` string into the crontask keeper.  Generated protobuf code already provides the `sdk.Msg` implementationâ€”no hand-written msg file is required.**
5. Implement `Keeper.removeOldTasks` and call from `BeginBlocker`.
6. Unit test to verify tasks older than the threshold are deleted; newer ones remain.
7. Ensure performance: iteration should break once tasks are newer than cutoff.

## Implementation Plan
1. Proto update, run `make proto-gen` (or equivalent).
2. **Keeper wiring**: add `authority` field (initialised with gov module address) and implement `UpdateParams` handler with authority check + `SetParams` call.
3. Adjust param parsing/validation code.
4. Implement removal logic using existing indexes (`i_status_ts`) for DONE/FAILED/EXPIRED, iterating oldest-first.
5. Wire into `BeginBlocker` after main execution loop.
6. Write unit tests in `x/crontask/keeper/old_tasks_test.go`.

## Verification
- `make test` passes, including new tests.
- Manual chain run: create task, mark DONE, advance time beyond cleanup window, confirm it disappears and logs show cleanup.
