# 1-3 Manual KV secondary indexes

## Description
Establish and maintain manual KV secondary indexes (`i_addr`, `i_status_ts`, `i_status_gas`) for crontasks so that they are always kept in sync with the primary `Tasks` collection.  This work now includes automatically updating these indexes inside `Keeper.SetTask`, mirroring the cleanup already performed in `Keeper.RemoveTask`.

## Status History
| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-06-12 10:00:00 | Significant Update | Review | InProgress | Scope extended to move index maintenance into `Keeper.SetTask` | ai-agent |

## Requirements
1. `Keeper.SetTask` MUST:
   - Remove index entries for an existing task (if present).
   - Create index entries for the new/updated task record.
2. Call sites MUST NOT manually invoke `k.removeIndexes` / `k.addIndexes`.
3. All existing functionality (task creation, deletion, BeginBlocker lifecycle) must continue to work and all tests must pass.

## Implementation Plan
1. Modify `x/crontask/keeper/keeper.go` – enhance `SetTask` to automatically handle index removal and addition.
2. Remove redundant `k.removeIndexes` / `k.addIndexes` calls from:
   - `x/crontask/keeper/abci.go`
   - `x/crontask/keeper/msg_server.go` (CreateTask)
3. Update documentation and run `make test` to validate.

## Verification
- Run full test suite (`make test`) → All tests pass.
- Manual scenario: create tasks, advance blocks to trigger status changes, delete tasks, and confirm no orphaned index keys exist (no "failed to load task" logs).

## Files Modified
- `x/crontask/keeper/keeper.go`
- `x/crontask/keeper/abci.go`
- `x/crontask/keeper/msg_server.go`
