## Requirements
* `names.html` page with tabs/sections for:
  * Update name (destination, valuation) - **prepopulated with current values**
  * Coins (mint, send, move, burn) - **mint form with denom defaulting to current name**
  * NFTs (class, mint, update, send, move, burn) - **update class form prepopulated with current data**
  * Trading (bid, accept, reject)
* New `namesStore.js` providing Alpine stores:
  * `namesComponent`, `coinsComponent`, `nftsComponent`, etc.
* Re-use `walletStore.sendMsg` for tx submission.
* Integrate SRI hashing & import-map pipeline.

## Guiding Principles
* **Flat over nested** – keep the primary operations visible at page-load; avoid multi-level accordions or modal stacks.
* **One-click rule** – every primary action is reachable in ≤ one click from `/names`.
* **Deep-linkable** – each primary section has a stable anchor (`#/names#coins`, etc.) so users can bookmark or share.
* **Immediate feedback** – inline validation, spinner states, and toast/alert with the resulting tx hash.
* **Permission-aware UI** – forms auto-disable when the connected wallet lacks the authority to perform the action and surface a short, inline explanation (e.g. "Connect a wallet that owns bob.dys to mint its coins").
* **Always-visible & wide forms** – avoid hide/show clicks; prefer horizontal, inline inputs so common actions fit in one viewport without scroll.
* **Pre-populated forms** – forms should be pre-filled with current values where applicable to reduce user friction.
* **Frameset-based layout** – use HTML `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements to group related form controls and provide semantic structure.
* **DaisyUI research** – use Context7 to research DaisyUI CSS framework documentation for optimal component usage and styling patterns.
* **Accessibility & performance** – semantic HTML, keyboard-navigable controls, Lighthouse ≥ 95.

## Primary User Flows
1. **Update Name** – Change destination or valuation (pre-populated with current values).
2. **Manage Coins** – Mint, send, move, burn custom coins tied to a name (mint form defaults denom to name).
3. **Manage NFTs** – Create class under a name, mint/update NFTs, send, move, burn (update forms pre-populated).
4. **Trade Names** – Bid, accept, reject offers.

## Information Architecture
* Single page: `/names`.
* Flat vertical layout with a main block:
  * **Names Dashboard** – for each owned *name* we render a sub-section (dynamic anchor `#name-bob.dys`, `#name-alice.dys`, …) that contains **all** associated operations laid out horizontally in this fixed order:
     * **Update Name** form (pre-populated with current destination/valuation)  |  **Mint Coins** form (denom defaults to name)  |  **Coins List**  |  **Move/Burn Coin** forms  |  **NFT Classes List**  |  **Update Class** form (pre-populated with current class data)  |  **Mint NFT** form  |  **NFTs List**  |  **Update / Move / Burn NFT** forms.
* No accordions, tabs, or card flips – use `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements to semantically group and separate functional areas.
* Sticky in-page nav bar scroll-spies to the first name anchor.

## Interaction Details & Deep-Link Routes

### Names Dashboard (dynamic anchors `#name-<id>`)
* Section renders once wallet is connected; if not, a centered helper text explains the requirement.
* **Update Name form** – destination & valuation fields **pre-populated with current NFT data**; disabled if wallet isn't the owner.
* **Mint Coins form** – denom field **pre-filled with `<name>`** (e.g., `bob.dys`); disabled if not owner.
* **Coins List** – table of all denoms that match `<name>` or its sub-paths (`<name>/<sub>`). Each row shows **total supply** & **metadata**.  Adjacent **Move** & **Burn** coin forms default to the denom of the selected row.
* **NFT Classes List** – table of all classes derived from the name.  Row-inline **Update Class** forms **pre-populated with current symbol/description** & **Mint NFT** forms use the class_id as default.
* **NFTs List** – nested only one level: shows NFTs for the current class with inline **Update / Move / Burn** forms.
* Deep-link examples:
  * `/names#name-bob.dys` scrolls to the *bob.dys* dashboard.
  * `/names#name-bob.dys?denom=bob.dys/credits` focuses the Move Coin form for that denom.

### Coins (`#coins`)
* Alpine store: `namesCoinsStore`.
* Balances list filtered by `ownedNames`.
* **Mint form denom field defaults to selected name**.
* Deep link: `/names#coins` scrolls & focuses *Mint* denom input.

### NFTs (`#nfts`)
* Alpine store: `namesNftsStore`.
* Class creation suffix optional; class dropdown auto-updates post-creation.
* **Update class forms pre-populated with current class data**.
* Mint form disabled until at least one owned class exists.
* Deep link: `/names#nfts?class=bob.dys/art` selects class in dropdown.

### Trading (`#trade`)
* Placeholder until backend routes stabilise.
* Deep link: `/names#trade`.

## Development Checklist
- [x] **Research DaisyUI**: Use Context7 to research DaisyUI CSS framework documentation for optimal component patterns, form styling, and layout utilities
- [x] **Update Name forms**: Pre-populate destination and valuation fields with current NFT data from nameservice
- [x] **Mint Coins forms**: Default denom field to current name (e.g., `bob.dys`)
- [x] **Update NFT Class forms**: Pre-populate symbol and description fields with current class data
- [x] **Frameset structure**: Wrap all form sections in `<fieldset>` elements with appropriate `<legend>` labels for semantic grouping
- [x] **Fix duplicate key warnings**: Ensure unique keys for Alpine x-for loops to prevent duplicate key warnings
- [ ] `names.html`: implement two-column grid inside each name section so forms read left-to-right (wide) instead of stacking.
- [ ] Ensure all forms include `x-show="canPerform"` bindings where `canPerform` encapsulates permission logic and `x-bind:disabled` states.
- [ ] `namesStore.js`: split into dedicated stores (`registerNameStore`, `updateNameStore`, `namesCoinsStore`, `namesNftsStore`, `namesTradingStore`) and expose `scrollToAnchor()` util that runs on page `DOMContentLoaded`.
- [ ] Remove nested accordions; replace with `<fieldset>` groupings for semantic structure.
- [ ] Ensure hash-change listener updates `activeTab` state.
- [ ] Keep existing SRI hashing & import-map pipeline intact.

## Verification (Acceptance Criteria)
1. Navigating directly to each `#name-<id>` deep link focuses the relevant wide form and explains disabled state if ownership missing.
2. **Update Name forms are pre-populated with current destination and valuation from the NFT data**.
3. **Mint Coins form has denom field defaulting to the current name**.
4. **Update NFT Class forms are pre-populated with current class symbol and description**.
5. **All form sections are wrapped in semantic `<fieldset>` elements with descriptive `<legend>` labels**.
6. **DaisyUI components and styling patterns are used consistently throughout the interface**.
7. **No Alpine duplicate key warnings in browser console**.
8. Minting a coin instantly refreshes the balances list.
9. Creating an NFT class appends it to the dropdown without page refresh.

## Files Modified
* `demo-dwapp/storage/templates/names.html`
* `demo-dwapp/storage/static/js/namesStore.js`
* (additional store files if split, e.g. `namesCoinsStore.js`) – ensure inclusion via `render_script_tags`.

## Test Plan
* Manual smoke test for each deep link.
* **Verify pre-population of all forms with current data**.
* **Verify semantic HTML structure with proper `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` usage**.
* **Verify consistent DaisyUI component usage and styling**.
* Cypress E2E (see task **6-7**) exercising Register → Reveal, Mint Coin, Create Class → Mint NFT.
