## Requirements
* Protobuf definition with fields (sender, class_id, nft_id, from_address, to_address).
* Keeper method `MoveNft`:
  * Verify `class_id` is owned by `sender` (`VerifyClassOwner`).
  * Ensure `from_address` & `to_address` are non-module accounts.
  * Transfer via `bankKeeper.SendCoins` equivalent for NFT `nftKeeper`.
* Event `EventNftMoved` {class_id, nft_id, from, to}.
* CLI / autocli command `nameservice move-nft`.
* Tests similar to 6-2.

## Implementation Plan
1. Update proto definitions and regenerate.
2. Add keeper logic & msg server wiring.
3. CLI command & swagger docs.
4. Tests.

## Verification
* Unit/integration tests pass.
* CLI call demonstrates transfer succeeds/fails correctly.
