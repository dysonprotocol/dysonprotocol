## Requirements
* New route handler that renders `names.html` template.
* Consolidate all Nameservice actions into sub-routes (HTMX/JSON) mirroring existing `/coins` patterns.
* Ensure CSRF/offline wallet flow remains unchanged (re-use `walletStore.sendMsg`).
* No breaking changes to existing endpoints.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create placeholder `names.html` in `demo-dwapp/storage/templates/` extending `base.html`.
2. Add route function(s) in `script.py` under `/names` path.
3. Register route in Flask/Bottle app (depending on current framework).
4. Update navigation bar.
5. Unit test route returns 200.

## Verification
* Visiting `/names` in local dev shows template with placeholder content.
* All other dwapp routes still work.

## Files Modified
To be listed.
