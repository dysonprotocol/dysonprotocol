# 6-7 E2E CoS Test

# NOTE: This task only needs to update the current nameservice e2e tests, not create new ones.

## Requirements
* Implement Playwright (or existing Cypress) test under `tests/e2e/` that:
  1. Registers a random name via UI commit-reveal.
  2. Mints custom coins & NFTs.
  3. Executes move-coins and move-nft flows.
  4. Places and accepts bids.
* Uses test wallet accounts seeded in fixtures.
* Runs headless in CI with `make test`.

## Implementation Plan
1. Reuse patterns from existing Coins E2E.
2. Leverage helper functions for tx polling.
3. Add assertions for balance/name ownership.

## Verification
* CI passes with new test.
* Failures clearly indicate unmet acceptance criteria.

## Files Modified
New test files only.
