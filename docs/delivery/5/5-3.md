# 5-3 Send Funds form

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Enable users to send coins from the `/coins` page. The form interacts with the existing walletStore and, on success, triggers a balance refresh.

## Status History
| Timestamp | Event Type | From Status | To Status | Details | User |
|-----------|------------|-------------|-----------|---------|------|
| 2025-06-12 15:30:00 | Created | N/A | InProgress | Task started | ai-agent |
| 2025-06-12 15:31:00 | Status Update | InProgress | Done | User approved send funds form | user |

## Requirements
1. Form captures recipient Bech32 address, amount, and denom.
2. Submit constructs `MsgSend` and calls `$store.walletStore.sendMsg`.
3. Disable inputs while sending; show spinner if desired.
4. On success, display tx hash and dispatch `balances-refresh` event.
5. On failure, display error message.
6. Inputs are disabled when no wallet is connected.

## Implementation Plan
Implemented in `coinsStore.js` as `sendFundsComponent`:
- Manages `to`, `amount`, `denom`, `sending`, `txHash`, `error` state.
- On submit, builds and broadcasts `MsgSend`.
- Emits `balances-refresh` to reload balances.
- Form UI updated in `coins.html` with Alpine bindings.

## Verification
- Connect wallet, enter address & amount, submit send; observe success banner & hash.
- Balances table updates automatically.
- Invalid input shows error, no tx broadcast.

## Files Modified
- `demo-dwapp/storage/static/js/coinsStore.js`
- `demo-dwapp/storage/templates/coins.html`

## Test Plan
Manual test with two wallets; ensure balances update and tx shows in explorer/logs.
