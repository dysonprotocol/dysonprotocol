# 5-1 Scaffold /coins page & route

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description
Create the basic `/coins` page in `demo-dwapp` with a server route and static HTML template containing placeholders for a balances table and a Send Funds form. No dynamic data yet; this task sets up the page skeleton and wiring so that follow-up tasks can progressively enhance functionality.

## Requirements
1. A new HTTP route `/coins` is served by demo-dwapp.
2. The response returns HTML that:
   - Loads htmx, Alpine.js, `walletStore.js`, and other existing global scripts.
   - Contains a `<div id="balances">` placeholder for the balances table.
   - Contains a `<form id="sendForm">` placeholder with recipient / amount / denom inputs (no logic yet).
3. Page loads without console errors when demo-dwapp is run locally.

## Implementation Plan
1. Locate demo-dwapp codebase under `./demo-dwapp` (templates in `demo-dwapp/storage/templates/`).
2. In `script.py`, add a new `@route(r"^/coins$")` handler that serves the `coins.html` template (mirroring existing routes like `/wallet`).
3. Create `coins.html` in `demo-dwapp/storage/templates/` extending `base.html` and including placeholders / script tags.
4. Ensure `base.html` nav bar includes a "Coins" link to `/coins`.
5. After committing, changes will be automatically deployed to `http://dys1sed558ht0t3dgndvaqtqxdneej0ajktrce7mww.localhost:1317/`; test by navigating there.
6. Verify skeleton loads with no console errors.

## Verification
- Navigating to `/coins` returns HTTP 200 and displays the static skeleton.
- Browser dev console shows no 404s or JS errors.

## Files Modified
- `demo-dwapp/script.py`
- `demo-dwapp/storage/templates/base.html`
- `demo-dwapp/storage/templates/coins.html`

## Test Plan
Simple task: verify that TypeScript/Go compiles (if server is Go), and page renders. No automated tests at this stage.
