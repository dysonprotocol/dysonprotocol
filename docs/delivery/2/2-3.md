# 2-3 Inject SRI Hashes for On-chain Static JS in Base Template

## Description
`base.html` currently references five on-chain ES-modules located under `/static/*.js` (walletStore, messageStore, scriptStore, storageStore, tasksStore).  Now that each storage entry records a `hash` field (Task 3-1), we want to expose that integrity information to the HTML so browsers can verify the modules just like the CDN-hosted ones.

This task adds **template variables** (e.g. `{{ walletStore_js_integrity }}`) to `base.html` and updates the Python `demo-dwapp/script.py` renderer to populate them from the corresponding `Storage` records.

## Requirements
1. Update `demo-dwapp/storage/templates/base.html`:
   - For every `<script defer type="module" src="/static/<name>.js">` tag, add an `integrity="{{ <name>_js_integrity }}"` attribute.
2. In `demo-dwapp/script.py`, before rendering `base.html`, fetch the storage entry for each static JS (index `static/<name>.js`) and read its `hash` field.
3. Keeper now stores `hash` as the complete `sha256-<base64>` string. The template just inserts it.
4. Pass these strings as template variables when calling `base.substitute(...)` so they get injected.
5. If a hash is missing or not prefixed with `sha256-`, omit the attribute (graceful degradation).
6. Add a unit test in `tests/nameservice/` (or new path) that mocks `_query` to ensure the correct hash is injected.

## Implementation Plan
1. Create helper `get_sri(specifier)` in `demo-dwapp/script.py` to:
   - Query storage; return computed `sha256-…` or `""`.
2. At top of each route that uses `base.html`, build a `context` dict containing the five variables returned by `get_sri`.
   - Merge with `{"main": main}` before `base.substitute()`.
   - Factor into a small helper to avoid duplication.
3. Modify `base.html` to reference the new variables.
4. Add tests: patch `_query` to return fake `hash` and assert rendered HTML contains `integrity="sha256-…"`.

## Verification
- `pytest tests/test_template_sri.py` passes.
- Browser dev-tools network tab shows each `/static/*.js` request with matching `integrity` attribute.

## Files Modified
- `demo-dwapp/storage/templates/base.html`
- `demo-dwapp/script.py`
- `tests/test_template_sri.py` (new)
