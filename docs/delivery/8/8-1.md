[Back to task list](./tasks.md) | [View Backlog](../backlog.md#user-content-8)

## Analysis
- **Purpose:** Capture detailed functional & non-functional requirements for NFT list/detail views, bidding flows, and listed flag management.
- **Non-functional Considerations:**
  - Security: ensure correct permission checks when accepting/rejecting bids.
  - Performance: paginate API calls to avoid large payloads.
  - Observability: add console logs for debugging.
- **Business Rules:** Bids must meet minimum increase and allowed denoms.

## Design
- **Technical Specifications:** Document REST endpoints, component hierarchy, states.
- **Architectural Compliance:** Reuse existing walletStore & HTMX patterns.

## Testing
- **Test Cases:** TBD.
- **Test Data Requirements:** Example NFT classes & bids.

## Change Plan
- **Files to Modify:** docs/delivery/8/prd.md, templates, script.py, js store.
- **Implementation Approach:** Iterative; implement routes then templates.
