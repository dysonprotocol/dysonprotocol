# 4-1 Implement proto & keeper changes

## Description
Add the `extract` (StorageGet) and `filter` (StorageList) functionality using GJSON, including proto amendments, regenerated code, keeper logic, CLI flags, and tests.

## Requirements
1. Extend `QueryStorageGetRequest` with `string extract = 3`.
2. Extend `QueryStorageListRequest` with `string filter = 3`.
3. Regenerate protobuf / gogo code.
4. Update keeper functions in `x/storage/keeper/grpc_query.go`:
   * In `StorageGet`, if `extract` is non-empty, apply `gjson.Get(storage.Data, extract)` and set `storage.Data` to the resulting raw JSON string (or empty if not found).
   * In `StorageList`, pre-filter with `filter` (when provided) and, in the transformFunc, apply the same extract logic before returning each pointer.
5. Add integration tests under `tests/storage/` verifying:
   * Extract returns partial JSON.
   * Filter excludes non-matching entries.
6. Ensure backwards compatibility when new fields are empty.

## Implementation Plan
1. Modify proto file `proto/dysonprotocol/storage/v1/query.proto` adding new fields (tag 3).
2. Run `make proto` (or project's proto generation command) to regenerate Go stubs.
3. Adjust keeper file as per requirements.
4. Add CLI flags in query command modules (optional later task).
5. Write unit tests in `x/storage/keeper` plus end-to-end integration tests.

## Verification
* `make test` passes with new tests.
* Manual `dysond` queries demonstrate correct extract/filter behavior.

## Files Modified
* `proto/dysonprotocol/storage/v1/query.proto`
* Generated protobuf files (via `make proto`)
* `x/storage/keeper/grpc_query.go`
* New/updated test files.
