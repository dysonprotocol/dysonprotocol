# Dyson Protocol – Everything On-chain

**Host Python scripts, serve decentralized websites, and run scheduled tasks with trustless, censorship-resistant execution. Trade names in a dynamic on-chain market, mint custom tokens and NFTs, and store arbitrary data—all fully on-chain.**

---

## What & Why

### Problem 
  - DApp UIs still load from centralized servers—developers host them off-chain, and end-users can’t self-host or audit the code.

### Solution  
  - Store HTML/CSS/JS assets in the chain’s storage so browsers load UI from the ledger.  
  - Push application logic on-chain and execute periodic jobs (crontasks) without any off-chain trigger.  
  - Run a dynamic on-chain name market using Harberger-style fees.  
  - Mint custom tokens and NFT classes based on on-chain names.  
  - Store arbitrary data in the chain’s storage module.

### Key Use Cases  
  - **Autonomous payouts**: schedule hourly dividend distributions without users having to claim.  
  - **Timed auctions**: start and end bids exactly on-chain, with no external cron.  
  - **Game rounds**: progress players automatically through time-boxed stages.  
  - **Price oracles**: post market data at fixed intervals, fully on-chain.  
  - **Nameservice-driven assets**: register and trade domain-backed NFTs in a live marketplace.

### Outcome  
  - DWapp developers host, verify, and update every layer—from UI to scheduling—directly on the chain. No servers, no hidden dependencies, fully trustless.
